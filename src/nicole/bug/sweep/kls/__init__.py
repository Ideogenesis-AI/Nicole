"""Local BUG/KLS bond updates for dense and U(1)-symmetric tensors.

This module contains the Python port of the local Lubich-style K/L/S update used
by the higher-level bug sweep. The main user-facing helper is
``_faithful_kls_local_bond_candidate``. Internally, the code is organized around
one explicit concept:

- ``LocalBondFrame`` gives names to the tensors and indices on the active bond
  so the update logic reads like the algorithm rather than a raw dictionary walk.
